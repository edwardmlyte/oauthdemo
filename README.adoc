= Spring Boot OAuth Demo

This repo is based on the `auth-server` module within `[sping-guides/tut-spring-boot-oauth2](https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-spring-boot-oauth2)`. Google authentication has been added.
In short, to deploy the application, run `mvn spring:boot` and then hit `http://localhost:8080` to see it in action.
